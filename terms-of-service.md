# Aqua Prime Genesis - Terms of Service

Welcome to Aqua Prime Genesis, where platypus-powered romance meets Web3 innovation! 🦆✨

## Disclaimer
By entering Aqua Prime Genesis, you acknowledge that you're diving into a unique dating experience where semi-aquatic monotremes seek meaningful connections. While we encourage playful interactions, we maintain strict boundaries to ensure everyone's comfort and safety. This isn't your typical dating pool - it's a carefully curated ecosystem where respect and consent are as essential as your virtual bill and webbed feet.

## Content Guidelines: The Lines & Veils System

Just like your favorite tabletop RPG, we use the Lines & Veils system to keep our platypus paradise fun and safe for everyone. Think of it as our social contract - where we all agree on what makes our dating pool a comfortable space for every bill and tail in the community.

### What are Lines & Veils?
- **Lines**: Hard boundaries that we never cross (like a platypus avoiding a hungry croc 🐊)
- **Veils**: Topics that can exist in our world but stay tastefully obscured (like a shy platypus behind water ripples 💫)

### Hard Lines (Absolutely Not Allowed) 🚫
- Explicit sexual content or nudity
- Harassment or non-consensual behavior
- Hate speech or discrimination
- Personal identifying information
- Financial scams or fraud
- Illegal activities
- Underage users (18+ only)

### Veils (Allowed but Tastefully Obscured) 🌟
- Flirting and playful banter
- Character-based roleplay
- Virtual gifts and tokens
- Platypus-themed innuendos
- In-game currency transactions
- Virtual dates and meetups
- Genetic modification jokes
- Time-travel paradoxes
- Multi-dimensional relationships

Our community thrives on playful banter and charming connections, but just like a platypus knows when to dive for safety, we maintain clear boundaries to keep everyone comfortable and secure.
